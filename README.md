# MableBot

## Still WIP
### Overview
Maple is a general AI chatbot that can make a conversation, answer questions, use common sense.
We aim to make Maple become a general AI as much as it can. So far, Maple has only stopped at basic conversation. We are currently working on making Maple use its common sense and memory to answer questions.

### How does it work?
Currently, Maple is mostly based on Intent Classification with many rule-based decisions. Our model is mainly LSTM.
